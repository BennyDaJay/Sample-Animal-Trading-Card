            Wolves are very beautiful creature, what makes them stand out from
            the other animals is the way they socialize. A male wolf mates with
            only one female for the rest of his life, and when a wolf gets old,
            they don't just leave him/her to die but take good care their old
            ust like humans do.

          Wolves are large, social carnivores known for their strong pack
          dynamics and adaptability. Weighing between 80 to 100 pounds, they
          hunt large prey like deer and elk and communicate through howls. Packs
          have a hierarchical structure led by an alpha pair. Despite historical
          widespread distribution, wolf populations have declined due to habitat
          loss and human conflict, prompting conservation efforts. For more
